# hw one
- "ok create a project" in github featuring a boilerplate `index.html` file and a `readme.md` file
- second thing, if you want to try to style your `MD` a pretty good reference is `dillinger.io`
- third thing, go ahead and use an `HTML boilerplate` and just copy paste the code online. Having to manually type in a blank `HTML` document is crude an a waste of your time.

## how do you expect me to even do this?
1. log into your `GitHub`
2. click the `+` in the upper right and `select` `Create New Repo`
3. call the repo `homework1`
3. initialize that `Repo` with a `Readme.MD` file by `pressing the right checkbox during the creation screen`

1. now we want to work on the `boilerplate`
2. find a `HTML5` boilerplate online or use this one
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  
  </body>
</html>
```
3. press `create new file` from the `github.com` new repo page you just created
4. call that file `index.html`
5. paste in the `boilerplate`
6. profit

# Lesson 4

What happened in class Review

- HTML `<textarea>` Tag: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_textarea.asp

- List of all HTML5 allowed imput types, yes even color: http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp

Homework:
- add an image to your `index.html` file with the `img` tag.
- find an `URL` of an `image` on the `internet` somehwere and copy paste that `url` into the `src=""` part of your `img' tag in order to display said image in a `JS bin`
- do this in `JS bin` first so you can check that it works, and when you are done paste it into your `index.html` on `GitHub` thus updating that file.
- your index.html file should now have an `image` in it as well as all the former things
- don't worry about where the image is physically in the file, just put it somewhere that looks good

Homework part two (2):
- take a screen shot of you succesfully `web instpecting` the image found on a regular site, like maybe, [ "nytimes", "nypost", "espn", or something like that]

# Lesson 6
Homework is to find images online, `hack` the width using the method below so that way you can use an image you found even if its too large.

Combine various `html` elements, such as `ul` `li` `p` `span` `h1` & `div`'s in order to make your image mellee. Use at least 10 (ten) images and use `all` of the `html` elements above, keeping in mind if they are `block` or `inline`.

Here are the links to the `block` v `inline`
[block elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements)

[inline elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements)

Homework

- make your own website
- **always start with** a `index.html` page and additional `something.html` and more if you feel comfortable
- make a `image` folder and `download` about 7 (seven) images off the web to use there a handfull of images, so keep them in _all in_ there
- make `relative` links to the images 
- make sure you make the `navbar` **important** using `ul` `li` and `a tags` I don't care if it just looks like a bulleted list of links, I can show you how that gets _stylized_ in order to make look right later, just do the basics now.
- make `relative` links to the other `html` files using a `navbar`
- **use layout on page** `432` of the book

How do I turn this in?
- since you made this website in it's own `folder` probably on your desktop...
- go to your homework repo
- `click` on `upload files`
- **drag** the folder from your desktop to this window, then click `upload`
- then it will show the `foldername` in your repo all nice and you can click around in there to verify 

# Lesson 8

- Objective: add more things to your `mini_site`
- Objective: use `github` the right way

Todo's
1. add more things to site
2. Make a `git commit` and `push` `master branch` to the `git origin` which is your online repo

# Lesson 9

- Intro to css

- Homework:
- add a css file to your `mini_site`
- `source` that file in your header 
- (browse that codebase from class here)[https://github.com/zackn9ne/module1_set1/tree/master/temp_proj]

** mini git workflow **

- `git add -A .`
- `git commit -m "commit message"`
- `git push origin master`
